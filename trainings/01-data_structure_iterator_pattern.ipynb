    "In Computer Science, it is traditional to discuss speed in abstract term, rather than in concrete time. This remove the hardware (and load) dependency (but introduce some hypotheses regarding the uniformity of some basic operations). For data structure, the *complexity*, is established with respect to the size of the problem; the number of elements in the structure. \n",

    "If $N$ is the number of elements, we usually talk about $O(\\log N)$, $O(N)$, $O(N \\log N)$, $O(N^2)$. This notation inform on the behavior of a operation when $N$ is large. For instance, $O(N)$ means that, once $N$ is large enough, the operation takes a time proportional to $N$. So if you double $N$, you can expect to wait twice as long. $O(1)$ means that the runtime is independent of $N$.\n",
