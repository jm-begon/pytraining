# pytraining
A set of training sessions for intermediate/advanced Python.

> Python 3.9 is the basis for the training.

## Installation
1. Run `make setup`
2. activate the virtual environment (`source .venv/bin/activate`)

You might need to supply the path to a Python 3.9 ([troubleshooting](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69109305/poetry-install-doesnt-create-env-folder-inside-project-folder-with-anaconda-pyt))


## How to
Once the environment is set and activated, checkout to your personal branch and go the `trainings` folders.

> The trainings are given in the form of notebooks. If the setup was successful, you should be able to run them. You might need an additional plugging to render the Markdown emojis, but this is dependent on your viewer.
